\chapter{Cosmic Rays}

Up to this point the book has focussed either on the propagation and
production of light that we ultimately detect, or the properties of
matter and its motion that produce the light.  The reader might get
the mistaken impression that light is the only messenger from the
matter in the cosmos.   In fact the matter itself is often a messenger
in the form of meteorites, interplanetary and interstellar dust.
However, here the focus will be on the elementary particles and nuclei
that travel to Earth at nearly the speed of light.
